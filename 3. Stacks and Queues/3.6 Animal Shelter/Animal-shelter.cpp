/*
 * PROBLEM 3.6 : Animal Shelter
 * An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first
 * in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival
 * time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would
 * prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They
 * cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to
 * maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny,
 * dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION:
 * Use the STL queue structure to store a queue of dogs and a separate queue of cats.
 *
 * Each animal is stored with the Animal struct, which dictates whether or not the
 * animal is a dog and keeps track of arrival order for animals.
 *
 * When you enqueue, check the type of the animal and add it to the appropriate
 * queue.
 *
 * When you dequeue_any, compare the timestamps of the tops of the two queues and
 * pick the Animal with the lesser timestamp.
 *
 * When you dequeue_dog or dequeue_cat, just pop and return the top of the respective
 * queue.
 *
 * WHAT COULD YOU IMPROVE?
 * I could add helper functions to pop a queue and return its value at the same time.
 * This way I could avoid repeating myself.
 *
 * Furthermore, I can create a class hierarchy with Animal on top and Cat and Dog
 * inheriting from Animal. This way I can simplify my code with polymorphism.
